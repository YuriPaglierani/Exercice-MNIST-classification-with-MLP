# Exercice-MNIST-classification-with-MLP
In these few rows of code is shown how to make a classification of the MNIST dataset using a Multilayer Perceptron.

To speed the code is better use a PCA before the training, in this way the training and convergence will be easier and faster
## Dataset
Before running the code make sure that you've downloaded (and put on the same folder of the code) the 4 files of MNIST dataset, you can find them clicking [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
