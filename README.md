# Exercise MNIST classification with MLP
In these few rows of code is shown how to make a classification of the MNIST dataset using a Multilayer Perceptron.

To speed the code is better to use a PCA before the training, in this way the training and convergence will be easier and faster.
## Dataset
If you want to run the code on your device make sure that you've downloaded (and put on the same folder of your code) the 4 files of MNIST dataset, you can find them clicking [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)
## What is MNIST?
The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a database containing 70000 handwritten images in white and black.

In the images are drawn numbers between 0 and 9, so the program will try to understand what number is represented in a given image
